# Bot-Client

Prerequisites
Step 1: Install Python
Download Python from the official Python website.
Important: When running the Python installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before continuing with the installation. This allows you to use Python commands from the command line.
Step 2: Install Project Dependencies
Clone this repository to your local machine, or download and extract the project files.

Open a command prompt (or terminal) and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.

Use the following command to install all necessary packages listed in requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all dependencies required to run the client.

Step 3: Run the Client
Once dependencies are installed, you can start the client by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python Client.py
The client should now be up and running, ready to connect to the server and receive commands.
